## Introduction &#x1F499; 

* Defining NSFW material is subjective and the task of identifying these images is **non-trivial**
* Input RGB image of size 224x224x3 - Identification into two categories:

  * [SFW] positively trained for **neutral images** that are safe for work
  
  * [NSFW] negatively trained for **pornographic images** involving sexually explicit images


## Machine Learning  &#x1F499;

* Machine Learning methods for object recognition  

**Labeled image-training datasets**
  
  1) Small image datasets
    * Order of tens of thousands of images
    * Classic example MNIST digit-recognition task with best error rate
    
  2) Large image datasets
    * Order of hundreds of thousands of images
    * ImageNet or LabelMe
 
**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

  * Theoretically best -> Large learning capcity and complexitty
  * Stationarity of statistics
  * Locality of pixel dependencies


**ImageNet**

  * Dataset over 15 million labeled images
  * Variable-resolution images (256x256)
  * Training, validation, and testing images
  * Annual competition - ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)

## NSFW Images  &#x1F499;

**Types of Images to be analyzed:**

  * Static images
  * Uncontrolled backgrounds
  * Multiple (more-than-one) people
  * Partial figures
  * Different camera angles

## NSFW Object Recognition: Content-Based Retrival &#x1F499;


**1) Find image location with large areas of skin-colored regions:**

  * Skin regions in an image and color and texture properties 
  * Input RGB values with log-oppoent representation
  * Intensity of image smoothered with median filter subtracted with original image
  * QBIC search - operator uses absraction of an image to search for colored textured regions

**2) Find elongated regions:**

  * Grouped constraints on body/skin regions
  * Modelling humans == cylindrical parts within the skeleton geometry
  * 3D and 2D grouping constraints
  * Imaging model to identify region outlines

**3) Classify regions into possible human limbs:**

  * Geometric grouping algorithms - matching a view to a collection of images of an object
  * Make a hypothesis object is present, and an estimate of appearance
  * Future vector from compressed image 
  * Minimum distance classifer to match feature vectors

## Classifier - VGG16 model &#x1F499;

* VGG16 is a CNN for large-scale image recognition 
* Model achieves **92.7% top-5 test accuracy** on ImageNet
* Implemented with Keras and Tensorflow backend in this project

[Insert Image of VGG16 architecture]

**VGG16 Architecture**

* Fixed input of 224 x 224 RGB image
* Three fully-connected (FC) layers 
  * 4096, 4096, and 1000 chanels respectively
* Max pooling layers
* Hidden layers have ReLu Retification
* Final layer is soft-max layer
* **Total 16 layers**

**VGG16 Disadvantages**

* Super slow (weeks to train)
* Large disk/bandwidth network achitecture (+533MB)
* Consider varient classifer -> VGG19


**VGG16 Keras Implementation**

## Error: Overfitting and GPU Implementation  &#x1F499;

Large size of network with 1.2+ million labeled image training examples leads to errors that need to be reduced.

**Overfitting**

1) Data augmentation: 
  * Label-peserving transfomations: 
    * Transformed images do not need to be stored on the GPU disk
    * Image translation and horizontal reflections
  * RGB channel intensities: 
    * Add a transformation (covariance matrix) to each RGB image pixel
    * Object idenity is invariant to changes in intensity/colour of images
  
2) Dropout
  * ReLu neutrons 
  * Dropout is used for first two fully-connected layers
  

**GPU Implementation**

* CNN + image datasets = heavy computation required
* Highly optomized implementation of 2D convolutions
* Size of CNN network limited by GPU memory avaliabe
* Solution to spread network over multiple GPUs via parallel processing

## Technical Installations - requires heavy computation &#x1F499;

1. Install Python dependencies and packages (**Keras, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow.js**) - best to run from [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
   
2. Download and convert the VGG16 model to TensorFlow.js format

3. Launch Node.js script to **load converted model** and compute **maximally-activating input images** for  convnet's filters using gradient ascent in the input space. Save image files under `dist/filters` directory 
   
4. Launch Node.js script to **calculate internal convolutional layers' activations** and gradient-based **Class Activation Map (CAM)**. Save image files under `dist/activation` directory
   
5. Compile. Launch web view at **https://lucylow.github.io/salty-wet-man/**


---


## Technical Visualizations &#x1F499;


```sh
yarn visualize
```


Increase the **number of filters to visualize per convolutional layer** from default 8 to larger value (ex. 18):


```sh
yarn visualize --gpu --filters 18
```


Default image used for **internal-activation** and **CAM visualization** is **"nsfw.jpg"**. Switch to another image by using the **"--image waifu-pic.jpeg"** ðŸ‘€


```sh
yarn visualize --image waifu-pic.jpeg
```
