## Introduction &#x1F499; 

* Defining NSFW material is subjective and the task of identifying these images is **non-trivial**
* **Salty-Wet-Man identifies images into two categories:**

  * [SFW] positively trained for **neutral images** that are safe for work
  
  * [NSFW] negatively trained for **pornographic images** involving sexually explicit images


---


## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) &#x1F499;
  
**Image Datasets**

  * **Theoretically CNN is best** since large learning capacity and complexity
  * Stationarity of statistics
  * Locality of pixel dependencies  

**NSFW Images**

  * Static images
  * Uncontrolled backgrounds
  * Multiple people and partial figures
  * Different camera angles


**GPU Implementation**

  * **Heavy computation required** - Size of CNN network limited by GPU memory avaliabe
  * Highly optimized implementation of 2D convolutions
  * Solution to spread network over multiple GPUs via **parallel processing**

## Object Recognition &#x1F499;

**Deep Learning's Impact on Computer Vision**

   ![deep learning impact](https://github.com/lucylow/salty-wet-man/blob/master/readme-images/object%20detection%20-%20impact%20of%20deep%20learnning.png)

**Labeled Image-Training Datasets**
  
  * Small image datasets (order of tens of thousands of images) -  MNIST digit-recognition with best error rate  
  * Large image datasets (order of hundreds of thousands of images) - ImageNet
 

**[ImageNet used for Large Scale Object Recognition](www.image-net.org)**

  * **Dataset over 15 million labeled images**
  * Variable-resolution images (256x256)
  * Training, validation, and testing images
  * **Benchmark - ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)**

## NSFW Object Recognition: Content-Based Retrival via Localization &#x1F499;


**Image Location with Large Areas of Skin-colored Regions**

  * Skin region properties - image, color, and texture  
  
  * **Input RGB values (skin spatial pixels)** with log-opponent representation
    * L(x) = 105*logbaseten(x+1+n)
    * I = L(G)
    * Rg = L(R) - L(G)
    * By = L(B) - (L(G) + L(R))/2
    
  * Intensity of image (texture) smooth-ed with median filter, then subtracted from original image
  
  * **Query By Image Content (QBIC)**
    * Absraction of an image to search for colored textured regions
    * Uses image decomposition, pattern matching, and clustering algorithms
    * Find a set of images similar to a query image


        ![Image retrival algorithm](https://github.com/lucylow/salty-wet-man/blob/master/readme-images/QBIC%20pipeline.png)

**Elongated Regions Grouping**

  * Group **2D and 3D constraints** on body/skin regions
  * Model human body == **cylindrical parts within skeleton geometry**
  * Identify region outline


**Classify Regions into Human Limbs**

  * **Geometric grouping algorithms** - matching view to collection of images of an object
  * Make hypothesis object present, and an estimate of appearance via **future vector from compressed image**
  * Minimum distance classifer to match feature vectors

## NSFW Object Recognition: Detection, and Segmentation &#x1F499;

* Object Image Segmentation
  * **Group together skin pixels**
  * Normalized cut 
  
* Input image each pixel with a category label
  > For every pixel: 
  >   Check if the pixel [skin or not-skin]

* If atleast 30% of the image area skin, the image will be identified as passing the skin filter 

* Training data for this super expensive - need to find images with every pixel labeled


    ![RNN2](https://github.com/lucylow/salty-wet-man/blob/master/readme-images/RCNN2.png)

---

## NSFW Object Recognition: Image Cropping &#x1F499;

* **How would salty-wet-man choose the image crops?**

* Brute force image cropping - sliding window approach (Bad)

* **Region proposals**
  * Looks for edges, and draw boxes around them 
  
* **Region detection without proposals**
  * **YOLO** - You only look once 
  * **SSD** - Single shot detector


---

## Neural Network Classifier - VGG16 model &#x1F499;

* VGG16 is a CNN for large-scale image recognition 
* **Model achieves 92.7% top-5 test accuracy on ImageNet**
* Implemented with Keras and Tensorflow backend in this project

   [Image of VGG16 architecture](https://github.com/lucylow/PlotNeuralNet/blob/master/examples/VGG16/vgg16.pdf)

**VGG16 Architecture**

* **Fixed input of 224 x 224 RGB image**
* Three fully-connected (FC) layers 
  * 4096, 4096, and 1000 chanels respectively
* Max pooling layers
* Hidden layers have ReLu Retification
* Final layer is soft-max layer
* **Total 16 layers**

**VGG16 Disadvantages**

* Super slow - takes weeks to train
* **Large disk/bandwidth network achitecture with +533MB**
* Consider varient VGG19 classifer

## Neural Network Errors and Overfitting &#x1F499;

**Data Augmentation**

  * **Label-peserving transfomations**
    * Transformed images do not need to be stored on GPU disk to save space
    * **Image translation and horizontal reflections**
    
  * **RGB channel intensities**
    * Add transformation **(covariance matrix) to each RGB image pixel**
    * Object idenity invariant to changes in intensity/colour of images
  
**Dropout Rates**

  * ReLu neutrons 
  * Dropout is used for first two fully-connected (FC) layers (4096 and 4096)

## Technical Installations - requires heavy computation &#x1F499;

1. Install Python dependencies and packages (**Keras, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow.js**) - best to run from [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
   
2. Download and convert the VGG16 model to TensorFlow.js format

3. Launch Node.js script to **load converted model** and compute **maximally-activating input images** for  convnet's filters using gradient ascent in the input space. Save image files under `dist/filters` directory 
   
4. Launch Node.js script to **calculate internal convolutional layers' activations** and gradient-based **Class Activation Map (CAM)**. Save image files under `dist/activation` directory
   
5. Compile. Launch web view at **https://lucylow.github.io/salty-wet-man/**


---


## Technical Visualizations &#x1F499;


```sh
yarn visualize
```


Increase the **number of filters to visualize per convolutional layer** from default 8 to larger value (ex. 18):


```sh
yarn visualize --gpu --filters 18
```


Default image used for **internal-activation** and **CAM visualization** is **"nsfw.jpg"**. Switch to another image by using the **"--image waifu-pic.jpeg"** ðŸ‘€


```sh
yarn visualize --image waifu-pic.jpeg
```
