## Introduction &#x1F499; 

* Defining NSFW material is subjective and the task of identifying these images is **non-trivial**
* Identification into two categories:

  * [SFW] positively trained for **neutral images** that are safe for work
  
  * [NSFW] negatively trained for **pornographic images** involving sexually explicit images


## Machine Learning Classifier &#x1F499;

* Machine Learning methods for object recognition  
  * Labeled image-training datasets 
  1) Small image datasets
    * Order of tens of thousands of images
    * Classic example MNIST digit-recognition task - best error rate
  2) Large image datasets
    * Order of hundreds of thousants of images
    * ImageNet or LabelMe
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  * theoretically best for large learning capcity and completixty
  * stationarity of statistics
  * locality of pixel dependencies


---

## GPU IMplementation &#x1F499;

* CNN + image datasets = heavy computation required
* current GPUs 
* higly optomized implementation of 2D convolutions
* Size of CNN network limited by GPU memory avaliabe
  * Spread network over multiple GPUs via parallel processing 

---

## VGG16 model &#x1F499;
* training images, validation images, and testing images
*
*
---


## Overfitting &#x1F499;

* Large size of network with 1.2+ million labeled image training examples == overfitting
* Data augmentation: 
  * Label-peserving transfomations: Transformed images do not need to be stored on the GPU disk. Image translation and horizontal reflections
  * RGB channel intensities: Add a transformation (covariance matrix) to each RGB image pixel. Object idenity is invariant to changes in intensity/colour of images.
* Dropout
  * ReLu neutrons 
  * dropout is used fr first two fully-connected layers

## Technical Installations - requires heavy computation &#x1F499;

1. Install Python dependencies and packages (**Keras, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow.js**) - best to run from [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
   
2. Download and convert the VGG16 model to TensorFlow.js format

3. Launch Node.js script to **load converted model** and compute **maximally-activating input images** for  convnet's filters using gradient ascent in the input space. Save image files under `dist/filters` directory 
   
4. Launch Node.js script to **calculate internal convolutional layers' activations** and gradient-based **Class Activation Map (CAM)**. Save image files under `dist/activation` directory
   
5. Compile. Launch web view at **https://lucylow.github.io/salty-wet-man/**


---


## Technical Visualizations &#x1F499;


```sh
yarn visualize
```


Increase the **number of filters to visualize per convolutional layer** from default 8 to larger value (ex. 18):


```sh
yarn visualize --gpu --filters 18
```


Default image used for **internal-activation** and **CAM visualization** is **"nsfw.jpg"**. Switch to another image by using the **"--image waifu-pic.jpeg"** ðŸ‘€


```sh
yarn visualize --image waifu-pic.jpeg
```
