### General
Not Suitable for Work (NSFW) image classification using Keras and Tensorflow machine learning tools.

### Classifier 
* Defining NSFW material is subjective and the task of identifying these images is non-trivial.
* Identification into two categories
  * [SFW] positively trained for neutral images that are safe for work ex anime.
  * [NSFW] negatively trained for pornographic images involving sexually explicit images, sexual acts, hentai, or pornographic drawings.

### Tools
* TensorflowJS Image Model
* Keras Image Model
